# FEFatesCalcTool
Command-line based tool for checking and filtering growth rate values of any class + character combi for Fire Emblem Fates.

Before downloading or cloning this repository, make sure you've got Python 3.6 installed, along with the tabulate library:
Python 3.6: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Tabulate Library: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tabulate

To use the program, run Python IDLE, open FECalculatorPython.py, and click "Run > Run Module".

Alternatively, open a command-line terminal, change directories until you find the FEFatesCalcTool folder, and then run "py FECalculatorPython.py" or "python FECalculatorPython.py", depending on how your python environment variable is set.

This is still a work in progress; I'm planning on adding features relative to how each character's own stats grow, and eventually create a GUI for the program.
